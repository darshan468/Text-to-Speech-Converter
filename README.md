# Text-to-Speech-Converter
This is a simple Python script that converts text into an audio file. It uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to save the spoken text as an MP3 file. You can choose the text and the language for the conversion.

# What It Does
The script takes two inputs from the user:

The text you want to convert into speech.

The language code for the desired voice (e.g., 'en' for English, 'hi' for Hindi, 'ta' for Tamil).

After you provide these inputs, the script generates an audio file (audio2.mp3) containing the spoken version of your text.

# Supported Languages
The gTTS library supports many languages. You can find a full list of language codes here. Some common examples include:

English: en

Spanish: es

French: fr

German: de

Hindi: hi

Tamil: ta

Japanese: ja
